# Hi, I'm Martin.

I'm a **web developer** based in Europe. I work primarily with Next.js-based applications, but often dabble in other technologies as well.

This blog serves as a record of my research, experiments, and thoughts in the world of web development, cybersecurity, and other tech-related topics.
